# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2021 (STARTING DAY!!)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML and HTML5 section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Starting over from scratch. Taking this challenge in order to push myself to actually create content, so I can make a few mock websites and apps, learn how to solve algorithm problems! I have attempted 100 days of code unsuccessfully 3 times before this, my best record is 48 days. With that being known, I don't plan on failing this time. I'm ready to grind and learn, take the necessary steps in order to be one the best...

**Today's Progress**: Completed FrontEnd Masters Bootcamp "Introduction to HTML" section

**Thoughts**: Sticking to HTML, going to rotate between a video course, a book, and hands on exercises every day. I still need to finish a Metrix Learning course for the workforce. Starting InternetingIsHard book tomorrow. Instead of timing myself this round Im going to finish sections of whatever im working on, no matter how long they may take.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
