# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2021 (STARTING DAY!!)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML and HTML5 section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Starting over from scratch. Taking this challenge in order to push myself to actually create content, so I can make a few mock websites and apps, learn how to solve algorithm problems! I have attempted 100 days of code unsuccessfully 3 times before this, my best record is 48 days. With that being known, I don't plan on failing this time. I'm ready to grind and learn, take the necessary steps in order to be one the best...

### Day 2: July 2, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Completed FrontEnd Masters Bootcamp "Introduction to HTML" section

**Thoughts**: Sticking to HTML, going to rotate between a video course, a book, and hands on exercises every day. I still need to finish a Metrix Learning course for the workforce. Starting InternetingIsHard book tomorrow. Instead of timing myself this round Im going to finish sections of whatever im working on, no matter how long they may take.

### Day 4: July 4, 2021 (Happy 4th of July ðŸŽ†)

**Today's Progress**: Read Chapter 3 of Interneting Is Hard

**Thoughts**: Chapter 3 was the final book chapter of basic HTML in Interneting is Hard. I will complete W3schools HTML exercises and quiz tomorrow, then im starting Traversy media's HTML&CSS Playlist on Youtube with over 50 projects, I also purchased his Modern HTML&CSS course on Udemy. So I need to finish the workforce course so I can add that to my to-do list. Ive been focusing on HTML for the for the first seven days, CSS will be next.

### Day 5: July 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Scored a 95% on W3Schools HTML quiz, 38/40 correct. I also completed Traversy Media's HTML Crash Course

**Thoughts**: I have completely refreshed on HTML, learned some new tags and hotkeys along the way. A lot of people think they have HTML down but I find that at least 5 new tags are added since the last time Ive done a beginner course every 6-8 months. So that part where developers are students for life is completely true. I will be starting CSS a little early, but my focus on it might take up the initial two extra days I have remaining from HTML giving me 9-10 days of CSS. Flexbox and Grid can easily take up 4 days easily.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
