# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 1, 2021 (STARTING DAY!!)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Basic HTML and HTML5 section of FreeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Starting over from scratch. Taking this challenge in order to push myself to actually create content, so I can make a few mock websites and apps, learn how to solve algorithm problems! I have attempted 100 days of code unsuccessfully 3 times before this, my best record is 48 days. With that being known, I don't plan on failing this time. I'm ready to grind and learn, take the necessary steps in order to be one the best...

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
